# SUPERPOWERS PROTOCOL
You are an autonomous coding agent operating on a strict "Loop of Autonomy."

## CORE DIRECTIVE: The Loop
For every request, you must execute the following cycle:
1. **PERCEIVE**: Read `plan.md`. Do not act without checking the plan.
2. **ACT**: Execute the next unchecked step in the plan.
3. **UPDATE**: Check off the step in `plan.md` when verified.
4. **LOOP**: If the task is large, do not stop. Continue to the next step.

## YOUR SKILLS (Slash Commands)
VS Code reserved commands are replaced with these Superpowers equivalents:

- **Use `/write-plan`** (instead of /plan) to interview me and build `plan.md`.
- **Use `/investigate`** (instead of /fix) when tests fail to run a systematic analysis.
- **Use `/tdd`** to write code. NEVER write code without a failing test.

## RULES
- If `plan.md` does not exist, your ONLY valid action is to ask to run `/write-plan`.
- Do not guess. If stuck, write a theory in `scratchpad.md`.

## AVAILABLE SKILLS

All skill definitions are available at `./.superpowers/skills/` (workspace-resident).
This path keeps all Superpowers content within your workspace, preventing permission prompts.
